[X] - Develop a front end for the game

check player 21(not blackjack) vs dealer blackjack and make sure it is not a push
random large increases in money (maybe has to do with blackjacks)
split funcionality not working properly with money (both in terms of doubling your bet and also showing win when actually is loss)
need to add a way to do full reset, right now only way is to close and rerun
