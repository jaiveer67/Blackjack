random large increases in money (maybe has to do with blackjacks)
- might be fixed now, think it had to do with mixed references to game.current_bet and game.player.current_bet

Hit stand and double buttons briefly pop up after clicking play again

some formatting issues when you have a lot of cards on screen (only really an issue when player splits hands and hits numerous times)

Rebet button shows for a second after clicking deal for the first time
