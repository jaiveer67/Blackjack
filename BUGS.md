Hit stand and double buttons briefly pop up after clicking play again

some formatting issues when you have a lot of cards on screen (only really an issue when player splits hands and hits numerous times)

Rebet button shows for a second after clicking deal for the first time

animation after busting on hit is a bit slow, doesn't look the best

screen shifts a bit after hand is finished in order to show results

title and mute button shift to right after pressing deal

split button shows if youve already split and could technically split again

if muted, automatically unmutes when music loops

mouse pointer still shows even if button is not able to be pressed
