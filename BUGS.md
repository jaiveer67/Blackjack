random large increases in money (maybe has to do with blackjacks)
- might be fixed now, think it had to do with mixed references to game.current_bet and game.player.current_bet

Issues with getting 21 when splitting (shows as blackjack but it shouldn't be, and it stops dealer from drawing until 17 and instead dealer just stands)

Hit stand and double buttons briefly pop up after clicking play again

some formatting issues when you have a lot of cards on screen (only really an issue when player splits hands and hits numerous times)

Player and dealer blackjack said player win instead of push

Getting 21 (non blackjack) on first split hand makes round end

money in top corner updates too soon
