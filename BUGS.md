some formatting issues when you have a lot of cards on screen (only really an issue when player splits hands and hits numerous times)

animation after busting on hit is a bit slow, doesn't look the best

screen shifts a bit after hand is finished in order to show results

title and mute button shift to right after pressing deal

split button shows if youve already split and could technically split again

Dealer hand shows a bit too quickly on player blackjack

if split hands and first hand has soft total, it shows both options even if it is 11/21 until 2nd hand is done, also still gives player option to hit (with 2 aces

11/21 hands flash 11/21 for a second before becoming 21)
